## Questions about the Courses

The course I'm currently working on is the `Storybook Controls Issue` repository.
I have some questions about this course:

1. How does the course feel?
2. How can the theory part be improved upon?
3. In what way could the `task.js`files be used in the theory part?
4. What are your thought about the coding steps?
5. Are the task descriptions of any help to the user?

Bear in mind that the current course currently doesn't function properly, as the 
github commit is not the one with the issue (I'm currently working on this). 
The goal is to get some feedback about the structure of the course and the task 
descriptions, as most of those have been generated with the use of AI.
