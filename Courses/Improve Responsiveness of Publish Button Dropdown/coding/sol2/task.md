Here is the master solution which was implemented in the git commit to solve the task specified in the second step. Please
compare your own solution with the master solution and correct any errors you encountered.

```javascript
    renderNewEntryWorkflowPublishControls = ({ canCreate, canPublish }) => {
      const { isPublishing, onPublish, onPublishAndNew, onPublishAndDuplicate, t } = this.props;
      return canPublish ? (
          <ToolbarDropdown 
            dropdownTopOverlap="40px"
            dropdownWidth="200px"
            renderButton={() => (
              <PublishButton>
                {isPublishing
```

As you can see, the `dropdownWidth` variable has been changed from **150px** to **200px**. You can find the `renderNewEntryWorkflowPublishControls` 
at around line 405.
