Congratulations on completing this coding course!

You have now gained a deeper understanding of how to approach adding a new feature, specifically a "Duplicate" 
functionality, to the Decap CMS editor interface. You've explored fundamental React concepts, considered UI styling, 
and learned how to implement interactive elements. You've also thought about the connection between front-end interactions 
and the necessary backend logic.

Your dedication to learning and problem-solving is commendable. To help us refine this course and create even better 
learning experiences in the future, we would greatly appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to fill out a short 
survey about your experience. Your feedback is invaluable! The survey can be found in the task tracker on the sidebar.

Thank you for your participation and valuable contribution!
