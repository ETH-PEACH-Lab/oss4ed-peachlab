Let's start development with downloading the [decap-cms](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms) repository:

1) Press on the `Run` button on the `Task` panel in this task to download the GitHub repository to your laptop
2) Move to the `Project File` view by clicking on the
   `Course` drop down menu on the top left

<div class="hint" title="Click me to see where the `Course` drop down menu is located">

TODO: describe it again and add a GIF to demonstrate how to find it and change the view
</div>

3) Press the `Check` button to be sure that you did everything right. The tests should pass.

Once those steps are complete, you are ready to move on to the next task.
