In React, user interactions, such as clicking a button or selecting an item, are typically handled using the `onClick` 
prop. When an element with an `onClick` handler is interacted with, the function assigned to this prop is executed. 
Understanding how to define and use these event handlers is crucial for making UI elements interactive. For the 
"Duplicate" functionality, you'll need an event handler that triggers the duplication process when the user selects 
the "Duplicate" option.
