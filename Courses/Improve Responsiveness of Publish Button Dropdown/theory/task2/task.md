Decap CMS employs a library called "styled-components" to manage the styling of its React components. This approach allows 
developers to write CSS directly within their JavaScript code, associating styles with specific components. This method 
helps in keeping styles encapsulated and improves the organization and maintainability of the codebase. Recognizing how 
styles are applied to components is important when you need to introduce new UI elements or alter the appearance of 
existing ones.
