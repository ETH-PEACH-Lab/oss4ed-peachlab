In this exercise, you will work on the `decap-cms`, a Git-based CMS for Static Site Generators. You need to address a UI 
issue with the 'Publish' button dropdown in the CMS interface, which is unresponsive when switching to the French locale. 
The text in the dropdown options is also cropped. 

**Task:** - Modify the CSS properties of the dropdown that appears when clicking the 'Publish' button to ensure it is 
responsive. The dropdown should either adapt its width to fit the content or have a larger minimum width to accommodate 
all potential text options in different languages. To reproduce the issue, change the locale to French in `config.yml`, 
navigate to publish a post, and observe the dropdown behavior. Your goal is to enhance the aesthetics and overall user 
experience of the CMS when publishing posts in different languages.
