Storybook is an open-source tool designed to streamline UI development, testing, and documentation. It operates by allowing 
you to build and showcase UI components in an isolated environment, separate from your main application's business logic 
and context. This isolation helps you focus purely on the component's appearance, behavior, and variations.

## Stories
The fundamental unit in Storybook is a "story." A story captures a single, rendered state of a UI component. For example, 
if you have a `Button` component, you might have stories like "Primary Button," "Secondary Button," "Button with Icon," or 
"Disabled Button." Each story demonstrates how the component looks and behaves with a specific set of properties 
(or "args").

## Addons
Storybook's functionality can be extended through "addons." These are plugins that provide extra features, panels, and 
integrations. Examples include addons for accessibility testing, design previews, or managing component properties.

### Control Addon
The "Controls" addon is one of Storybook's most powerful essentials. It can automatically generate a graphical interface 
that allows you and your team to dynamically edit the arguments (props) passed to your components without touching code. 
This interactive editing is invaluable for testing different component states, debugging, and demonstrating component 
capabilities. Understanding how such addons are structured and configured is key to extending their functionality.
