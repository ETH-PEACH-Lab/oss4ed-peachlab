Conditional rendering is a fundamental concept in building dynamic user interfaces. It refers to the practice of displaying 
different UI elements or content, or altering their behavior, based on certain conditions or the current state of the 
application. Essentially, you're instructing the system on how the UI should adapt to changing data or settings.

In JavaScript and UI libraries/frameworks, conditional rendering is typically achieved using standard JavaScript control 
flow statements or specific syntax provided by the UI library.
- **`if/else` statements:** Can be used to decide which block of UI code to execute and render.
- **Logical `&&` (AND) operator:** A common pattern for conditionally including an element is `condition && <Element />`. The 
`<Element />` will only be rendered if `condition` is true.
- **Ternary operator (`condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse`):** This is a concise way to choose between two expressions
(e.g., two different UI elements or sets of props) based on a condition.

When developing UI features, you'll often need to show or hide elements, or enable/disable functionality, based on 
configuration parameters or application state. For example, an "edit" button might only be shown to users with 
administrative privileges, or a set of advanced options might only become visible if a user explicitly enables them.
