Environment variables are values that are set outside of an application's code, existing within the environment where the 
application runs (e.g., your operating system, a server, or during a build process). They are a standard way to configure 
application behavior without altering its source code, making it adaptable to different deployment contexts like 
development, testing, or production.

## Common Use Cases:
- Storing sensitive information like API keys or database credentials, rather than hardcoding them.
- Defining the application's operational mode, often through a variable like `NODE_ENV` (e.g., `'development'` or `'production'`).
- Specifying external service URLs, ports, or feature flags that might vary between environments.

## Accessing Environment Variables
In Node.js environments, which are relevant for Storybook's tooling and development server, environment variables are 
typically accessible through the `process.env` object. For example, `process.env.API_URL` would retrieve the value of the 
`API_URL` environment variable.
