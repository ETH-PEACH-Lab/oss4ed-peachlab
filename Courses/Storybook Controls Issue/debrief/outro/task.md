Congratulations on completing the coding part of this course! Let's quickly summarize what you've accomplished:

- You familiarized yourself with a real-world GitHub issue in the Storybook project.
- You learned about Storybook parameters, TypeScript interfaces, conditional logic, and environment-aware configurations.
- You successfully modified the Storybook codebase to introduce a new disableActions parameter for the Controls addon.
- This involved defining the parameter type, accessing and processing it within the relevant component to create an 
effective state, and using this state to conditionally render UI elements.
- You also drafted documentation for this new feature. This is a significant contribution that enhances the flexibility 
of Storybook for its users!

The skills you've practiced here – understanding existing codebases, implementing new features based on requirements, 
and documenting your work – are invaluable. We encourage you to continue exploring open-source projects and contributing 
to the developer community.

To help us improve this course and understand your learning experience better, we kindly ask you to fill out a short survey. 
Your feedback is crucial for our research and for future iterations of this learning module.

Thank you for your participation and hard work!
