For any new feature to be useful, developers need to know it exists and how to use it. Your task is to add documentation 
for the new configuration option (disableActions) you've introduced. Explain what it does, its possible values, its 
default behavior, and provide a clear example of how a user would enable it in their Storybook setup.

    {/* Add a usage example here */}
  ```
