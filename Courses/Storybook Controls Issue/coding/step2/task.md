The `ControlsPanel` component needs to determine the effective state for disabling actions. This involves two steps:

1. Retrieve the value of the `disableActions` parameter you defined earlier for the current story.
2. Based on this retrieved parameter, and also considering specific runtime conditions (like whether Storybook is in 
"development" mode and if the story has pre-configured values), define a local boolean variable (e.g., 
`disableActionsEffective`) that will represent the final state for whether actions should be disabled. This variable will 
then be used by other parts of the component or hooks it calls to determine visibility/behavior of UI elements.

  How does the `ControlsPanel` access story-specific parameters? Look for a relevant hook.

  The logic for the effective disable state should ensure actions might remain enabled in development if a story has 
  configured values, even if the `disableActions` parameter from the user is true.

  This task focuses on correctly setting up this boolean variable based on all conditions.

  First, retrieve the parameter: 
  ```typescript
    const { /* other params */, disableActions: disableActionsParam } = useControlsParameters();
  ```

  Then, define the effective state: 
  ```typescript
    const disableActions = // This is the 'disableActionsEffective' state 
        (global.CONFIG_TYPE === 'DEVELOPMENT' && isStoryReady && hasStoryConfiguredValue) 
          ? false
          : disableActionsParam || (hasStoryConfiguredValue && !isStoryReady);
  ```
  
</div>
