Let's dive into the [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) project.

**TODO: some short introduction what is about especially what is `Edit` and `Remix` + a picture of what it looks like - without may details, but for a context**

In this course we will improve this project and implement a _new feature_ that
allows users to disable the `Edit` and `Remix` functionalities for
stories directly from the `Controls` panel.
This will give developers more fine-grained control
over their Storybook instances.

Before we jump into coding, let's understand **why we need this functionality**.
The GitHub issue [#28377](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/28377) describes a need for disabling story
editing and creation from the controls panel.
Take a few minutes to read through the issue:

1) _What are the main motivations behind this feature request?_
2) _Why would a developer want to disable these actions?_
