Welcome! In this course, you'll dive into the world of 
open-source development by tackling a real-world 
issue in [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook), 
a popular UI development tool. 
**Our main goal** is to implement a new feature 
inside a real application. 
We will share the context of the project in the next lessons.
