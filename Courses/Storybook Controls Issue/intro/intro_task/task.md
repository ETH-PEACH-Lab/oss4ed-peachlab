Welcome! In this course, you'll dive into the world of open-source development by tackling a real-world issue in Storybook, 
a popular UI development tool. Our main goal is to implement a new feature that allows users to disable the "Edit" and 
"Remix" functionalities for stories directly from the Controls panel. This will give developers more fine-grained control 
over their Storybook instances.

Before we jump into coding, let's understand the "why." The GitHub issue [#28377](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/28377) 
describes a need for disabling story editing and creation from the controls panel. Take a few minutes to read through the 
issue. What are the main motivations behind this feature request? Why would a developer want to disable these actions?
