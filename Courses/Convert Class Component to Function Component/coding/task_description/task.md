In this exercise, you are working on the `mattermost` project, which is an open source platform for secure collaboration 
across the entire software development lifecycle. Your task is to convert the Class Component located at 
`./components/admin_console/system_user_detail/team_list/team_list_dropdown.tsx` into a Function Component. 
The objective is to maintain the existing functionality of the component throughout this transition. Additionally, you 
need to ensure that all related tests are updated accordingly. If the tests fail due to dependencies on the Class 
Component behavior, they should be refactored to effectively test the same behavior within the new Function Component 
structure. While the use of `react-testing-library` is preferred for any new tests, it is not mandatory. As part of your 
submission, please document where and when this component is utilized so that QA can adequately test the changes.
