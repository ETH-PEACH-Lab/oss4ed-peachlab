Button and action handling refactoring using hooks for component interactions.

<div class="hint" title="Click here if you want to know what to do">
    <li> Update button structure to include an icon inside the MenuWrapper
    <li> Replace class-based Menu item actions with functional callbacks using useCallback
    <li> Export TeamListDropdown as a memoized component for performance optimization
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Click here if you want to know where to make the changes">
  The change needs to be made between lines:
    <li> 43 and 52
    <li> 47 and 58
    <li> 53 and 109
</div>
