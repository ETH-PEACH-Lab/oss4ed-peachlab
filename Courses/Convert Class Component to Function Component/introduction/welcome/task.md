Welcome to this coding course! In this course, you will learn how to refactor a React component to improve its readability, 
maintainability, and overall code quality. We'll be tackling a real-world issue from the 
[mattermost repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost), a popular self-hosted collaboration platform.
**Our main goal** is to implement a new feature inside a real application. We will share the context of the project in
the next lesson.
