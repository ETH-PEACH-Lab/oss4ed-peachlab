
# Testing the Changes

Now that you've successfully refactored the component, you now have to check if all the test work as intended. Therefore, 
we have to ensure that no test is reliant on the inherent behavior of Class Components. Your task is to rewrite the tests 
if necessary. 

The task can be split into the following steps:

- Check if any tests don't pass
- Understand why the tests don't pass
- Refactor the tests to make them independent of the components behavior

<div class="hint">
  Run the tests first to notice if any of them don't pass.
